For most women the change becomes visible around 20 th week for some near 30 th with just few not observing any changes at all. I wore my wedding ring for a total of 3 months before I had to take it off again at 8 weeks pregnant this time. Im not depressed abouthaving to buy maternity clothes that was actuallyfunbut themoment I couldnt take my ring off I criedWith somehard tugging and lotion I got it off.

<p>I didnt swell at all wore my rings the entire pregnancy all 41 weeks and even when my lower half swelled up from the c-section my fingers still stayed the same. Its nearly been 7 weeks since birth and theyre are still too small. I cant help but cry a little when I think that my wedding ring may actually be what led to the deal breakers in our marriage. I wore my wedding ring for a total of 3 months before I had to take it off again at 8 weeks pregnant this time. It depends on how quickly you get back to your pre-pregnancy weight but you shouldnt have to have your rings resized. First my engagement ring got snugthen a bit later my wedding band followed.

<p>Other things like your waist size thanks to shifting hip bones and perhaps your feet thanks to the pressure of carrying pregnancy weight may have permanently changed but not your knuckles. YES Every woman is different and whilst some might find themselves channelling their inner blimp somewhere along the line others will find that their swelling is barely noticeable. The third pregnancy caused my rings to not fit in the second trimester until a few months after delivering. Honestly I dont think this question has anything to do with your wife. It may not be the most comfortable thing to do but the resulting reduction in swelling will hopefully mean your. One of my major goals this year is to re-gain control of my health.
