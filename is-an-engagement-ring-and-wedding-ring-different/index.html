Wedding rings are often plain bands although they can have diamonds or stones and are often solid platinum gold or white gold. The rings are worn on the 4th finger of the left hand and it represents the commitment love. Total carat weight is likely to be far less in a wedding ring than an engagement ring even if.

<p>Though an engagement ring is evidently different from a wedding ring in appearance and purpose they come together to create a unique and unified set. Both rings are often worn together as symbols of love and commitment. Engagement rings are offered at the proposal. Wedding rings are given at the wedding ceremony as the bride and groom exchange their vows. For brides the wedding ring is typically on the simpler side when compared to the engagement ring and is worn directly next to a womans diamond engagement ring on her left-hand ring finger. The wedding band isnt given in advance of the wedding ceremony like the engagement ring but is instead given at the conclusion of the successful union as a symbol the marital vows.
