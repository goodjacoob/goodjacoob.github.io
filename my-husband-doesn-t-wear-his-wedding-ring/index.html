<p><strong>My Husband Doesn T Wear His Wedding Ring</strong>, I wear my wedding ring but I dont like anything about it. But my father has always worn his hand and had a new one made when his fingers got too arthritic for him to comfortably wear the original wedding ring and my dad is pretty much a pillar of a stable husband and parent so I can see where some women and men for that matter would crave this kind of thing from their husbands. The experience gave me a smidgen of empathy.</p>
