<p>You can always add anniversary bands to create a pretty stack later. The first thing to consider is whether you want your anniversary ring to be similar in style to the wedding and engagement rings. The second solidifies the promise.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-also-choose-to-put-them-away-safely-during-the-occasion-to-give-the-beautiful-wedding-ring-the-attention-it-deserves">You can also choose to put them away safely during the occasion to give the beautiful wedding ring the attention it deserves.</h3><p>The only practical reason I can imagine that you would actually need a wedding band is that your engagement ring is such a classic traditional engagement ring that no one would expect you not to have added a wedding band. Your engagement ring and wedding ring both represent the unity and bond that youve committed to one another on your wedding day. An engagement and wedding are both important milestones in life which over time have both steeped in tradition. Some people would even argue that the groom should buy both wedding rings as well as the engagement ring. Some move their wedding band to their right hand and use it as an excuse to start stacking rings there.</p>

<p>The second solidifies the promise. Engagement ring etiquette dictates that the engagement ring should be returned to the man if an engagement is broken up by mutual agreement or if the woman is the one who calls the wedding off. The wedding band is traditionally worn closest to the heart with the engagement ring on top of it. While some opt for anniversary rings that are the same precious metal type as their engagement and wedding band some may prefer a mixed metal look. The easiest way to match the engagement ring and wedding band is to purchase a set thats been designed to go together. They make buying matching rings almost a non-starter because you can purchase already matching sets with both the engagement ring and the wedding band included.

<p>But forgetting about it can cause serious last-minute panic as well. Leave the Ring A bride can also leave her engagement ring on the left hand meaning the groom will place her. Wear the wedding ring first. A wedding ring or commonly referred to as a wedding band is then given during the wedding ceremony and this band. Some people would even argue that the groom should buy both wedding rings as well as the engagement ring. The second solidifies the promise.

<p>Again according to tradition the groom would buy the brides wedding band. You can always add anniversary bands to create a pretty stack later. You can also choose to put them away safely during the occasion to give the beautiful wedding ring the attention it deserves. The fact that these rings will permanently remain on your finger makes it logical to wear it first. Even better sometimes you can get the grooms wedding band included in the set too if you want. The only practical reason I can imagine that you would actually need a wedding band is that your engagement ring is such a classic traditional engagement ring that no one would expect you not to have added a wedding band.
