<p>To sum it all up there are no actual rules on which hand does the engagement ring and wedding band go on. But after a month i asked my officemate who is also married why she is wearing the ring on her Right Ring finger she said that yun daw ang sabi ng pari. I reached for her left hand while she already had her right extended. If you do an internet search for the answer you will more than likely find something like this. Due to this tradition it became accepted to wear the wedding ring on this finger. A lot of people nowadays dont wear their wedding.

<p>For those who are left-handed however they may opt to wear the ring on their right hand so that it doesnt get in the way of your daily activities. The Latin word for left is sinister which in addition to this sense also has the same senses as the English word. My first wedding was with the rope and veil and the whole catholic idea. If you cant wear it on your hand slip it onto a chain and wear it as a pendant necklace. To sum it all up there are no actual rules on which hand does the engagement ring and wedding band go on. The Catholic wedding used to place the ring on the Left hand and even the Last civil wedding was on the left hand.
