<p>What is Soldering. Maybe you want to pass down your engagement ring as a family heirloomit might be. More often than not both the rings are seen as one. Soldering is Basically Fusing Two Bridal Rings together usually the Engagement Ring and the Wedding Band. They remain as a clean and perfect set all of the time. The rings will always be aligned perfectly too.

<p>At first I was all for it. Locking sets definitely are a great solution. Purchase a ring guard if you want to consistently wear your. If you want to sometimes wear your wedding band without your engagement ring however use ring adjusters to give your rings a slip-free fit and temporary connection. The process is called soldering because it uses a solder a metal alloy that melts at very low temperature. My mother is totally appalled by this and tells me I cannot do that.

<p>No more soldering your rings together. Many couples prefer to wear both rings separately on different fingers. Having the two rings soldered together prevents the wear and tear that can occur when rings rub against each other. Maybe you want to pass down your engagement ring as a family heirloomit might be. Soldering your engagement ring and wedding band together prevents scraping and allows you to wear them both comfortably. But what if you want to separate them again.
