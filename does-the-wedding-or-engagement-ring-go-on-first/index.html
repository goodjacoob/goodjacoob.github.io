<p>In the UK it is usual for the wedding ring to be placed on the finger first followed by the engagement ring. During a Wedding Ceremony. The wedding ring is worn first being closest to the heart and is then followed by the engagement ring. Tradition dictates that once you are married you should wear your wedding ring first so it is closer to your heart and engagement ring second. Which I always found funny considering the engagement ring comes first but I actually think it. It is far less common for engagement rings to be worn constantly although theres nothing to stop someone from doing so at which point the engagement ring.

<p>Many women will wear their wedding bands stacked underneath the engagement ring as well while some women choose to only wear one ring to represent both. Both the wedding ring and engagement ring are worn on the third or ring finger of the left hand and according to the rules of proper etiquette the wedding ring goes on first. The second solidifies the promise. Your wedding band is supposed to go on your hand first closest to your heart then the engagement ring goes on after it. Modern Day Women SayEngagement Ring First. Those of you who like to blaze new trails and embrace more modern traditions might choose to place your engagement ring first before the wedding band.

<p>Its a really crazy thing because the order of the Wedding Rings doesnt make any sense at all But well get to this in a minute. First well get the answer. On your wedding day you should switch your engagement ring to the third. In some places the traditional way of wearing a ring the engagement ring is transferred to the right hand on the wedding day so the wedding ring can be worn on the left hand and after the ceremony the engagement ring is transferred back to the left hand on top of the wedding ring. That means you can wear an engagement ring with no wedding band even after the ceremony. An engagement and wedding are both important milestones in life which over time have both steeped in tradition.
