<p>Exchange of Wedding Rings. So after the groom has put the ring on your finger your officiant will ask you for your ring. The Exchange of Wedding Rings represent the vows and promises the bride and groom have exchanged. There are two rings because there are two people each to make a contribution to the life of the other and to their new life together. He puts the wedding band on the brides finger while repeating a phrase like I give this ring as a sign of my love Then its the brides turn. In my opinion the wedding vows should contain the majority of your promises to each other with the ring exchange sort of being the icing on the cake.

<p>Turn to your maid of honor and ask for the ring. Rather the giving of the ring is viewed as bestowing upon the donee ie. Who should ring bearer. In almost all weddings at which I have officiated the best man holds both rings. There are two rings because there are two people each to make a contribution to the life of the other and to their new life together. While both the engagement ring and her wedding band are traditionally purchased by the groom the groom wedding band may still be in question.

<p>Giving Away the Bride or Couple. Since MOH usually holds the brides bouquet along with her own I recommend the Best Man holds all rings. Tradition has it that the bride andor her family buys the grooms wedding ring while the groom andor his family pays for the brides. The condition is marriage. Rather the giving of the ring is viewed as bestowing upon the donee ie. Typically the Maid Matron of Honor is holding the bridal bouquet her own bouquet and most likely has no pockets.
