<p>Therefore wearing a wedding ring is equally forbidden for both men and women. Wearing gold for men is widely regarded as forbidden in Islam. Whoever Allah guides none can misguide and whoever He allows to fall astray none can guide them aright. If a person believes that it creates love between the spouses and that removing it and not wearing it affects the martial relationship then this is considered Shirk. This enters into the beliefs of the Days of Ignorance. But men are not allowed to do so. Wedding Ring In Islam Rules For Bride And Groom Lovedevani Com.</p>

<p>In the Hanafi Madhhab the only jewellery men are permitted to wear is a silver ring. Yes its permissible in Islam for men and women to wear wedding rings although the mans ring should be simple and silver not Gold. Whoever Allah guides none can misguide and whoever He allows to fall astray none can guide them aright. There is no injunction on rings being forbidden - in fact the Prophet pbuh had a signet ring with which he used to place his seal on documents in wax. Abu Huraira reported that Allahs Apostle may peace be upon him forbade the wearing of gold signet ring. I think the ring had a symbol of an elephant on it.
