<p>Muslim men must not wear the ring on their index or middle finger as mentioned in the hadith. But when you dig deeper mens wedding rings have a long history that varies from culture to culture. In much of south and North America the ring digit is most usually related to marriage imagery. But a man married in an Eastern Orthodox church could end up using the right hand instead.
