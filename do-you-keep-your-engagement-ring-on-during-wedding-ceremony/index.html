This is a lovely way of assigning the mother of the bride with a very important task on what is undoubtedly a very special day for her daughter. Be sure to keep your wedding band on the bottom closest to your heart and your engagement ring on top. If you so choose you can simply not wear your engagement ring at all during your ceremony.
