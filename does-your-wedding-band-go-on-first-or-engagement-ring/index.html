<p>Wear Them On Ring Finger Engagement Ring On Top. To ensure the proper position some brides temporarily move their engagement ring to their right hand. Then after the nuptials they return the ring to their left hand over the wedding band. Thus the correct way to wear the rings together is the wedding band first and then the engagement ring worn on top of it. The wedding ring is worn first being closest to the heart and is then followed by the engagement ring. Wedding-ring fashions change over time but the wedding ring which is a concrete symbol of the marriage is always worn closest to the heart.

<p>Ditto pp its a personal choice but what I see most is the wedding band first on the bottom and then the engagement ring. Typically women wear the wedding band first and place the engagement ring over top because this puts the wedding band closer to your heart. Your wedding band is supposed to go on your hand first closest to your heart then the engagement ring goes on after it. Both the wedding ring and engagement ring are worn on the third or ring finger of the left hand and according to the rules of proper etiquette the wedding ring goes on first. You could wear your wedding band on top of the engagement ring because thats the order in which you received them or because you like how it looks that way. Thus wearing a symbol of love on that finger signified your everlasting love and devotion. Pin By Ashley Godwin On Someday Stacked Wedding Rings Vintage Wedding Band Wedding Bands.</p>
