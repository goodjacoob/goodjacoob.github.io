<p>Wedding rings are of course circular in shape and this in itself carries a symbolic meaning for the couple getting married. Even the wedding cake can be seen as a fertility symbol. On the ring the hands denote friendship the heart symbolises love while the crown is a sign. It is a sign of a commitment for one another and represents the love honour and faithfulness that you have for your spouse. The Wedding Ring is the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual bond which unites two loyal hearts in endless love. This is why its important to always keep your ring on regardless of where you are or what you are going. Meaning Of 3 Band Wedding Bands Wedding Rings Engagement.</p>

<p>While we almost always think first of marriage when the subject of rings comes up the Bible records no instances where a ring is used as a symbol of marriage or wedding vows. This is why its important to always keep your ring on regardless of where you are or what you are going. Unlike the Engagement Ring given before marriage as a fanciful token of love the Wedding Ring was not originally meant to be valuable exchanged token of love as is popular today or merely civil covenant sign of marriage-bond or sign of marriage-vow but mainly a legal covenant seal of guarantee or seal of co-signatory which secures the Bride. It is a sign of love and fidelity of your partner to you. With that being said the origins of the wedding ring as far as we know beginning in ancient Egypt are indeed connected to the shape of the circle symbolizing eternity and perpetual love. One of the earliest and most enduring style of wedding ring the fedegimmel ring became popular around the early 1100s and were worn to signify a couples betrothal and then wedding.
